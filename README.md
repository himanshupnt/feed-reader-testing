# Project Details
In this project Jasmine test suits are implemented. Feedreader. js has comments
describing how each test is implemented.

Clone or download this repository and open index.html in your browser to test
the app. To test if Jasmine tests are working fine (failing), simply change appropriate variable names 
in app.js or change appropriate css class names in index.html.
